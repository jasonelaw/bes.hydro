# bes.hydro

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `bes.hydro` is to provide functionality for open channel open channel (e.g., a sewer or stormwaterpipe) flow data. Pipe geometry calculations are included for calculating flow from depth and velocity, along with functions for calculating velocity and flow using the Manning equation. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of bes.hydro from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jasonelaw/bes.hydro")
```

## Example

Here is an example using included flow data; the depth, velocity, and flow columns are have had their measurement units set using the (units)[https://r-quantities.github.io/units/index.html] package. We can create a `CircularPipe` object to facilitate pipe calculations and give it a default roughness coefficient from an included list of coefficient values. The object can also be used for geometry calculations:

```{r example-data}
library(tidyverse)
library(bes.hydro)
library(units)
data(flow)
print(flow)
manning_coefficient$`Closed Conduit`$Brickwork$`Lined with cement mortar`
ABZ075 <- CircularPipe$new(
  diameter = 66/12, 
  slope = 0.00826,
  n = manning_coefficient$`Closed Conduit`$Brickwork$`Lined with cement mortar`[2],
  unit = "ft"
)
ABZ075$wetted_area(1.1)
ABZ075$wetted_perimeter(1.1)
```

We can also plot a depth vs velocity plot and add a Manning curve:

```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
flow |>
  plot_dv(depth, velocity, shape = 21) + 
  geom_manning_velocity(ach129, color = "red")
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
